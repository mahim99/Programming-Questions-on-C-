# Scenario Based Questions:
Q1: Calculate the circumference of a circle without using any libraries for rounding off and manipulation.\
The program requirements are as follows:\
•	The program should prompt the user to enter the radius of the circle.\
•	The program should then prompt the user to enter the precision (number of decimal places) required for the circumference.\
•	The program should calculate the circumference of the circle using the formula \
•	2πr, where  r is the radius.\
•	The program should output the circumference with the specified precision.\
•	Ensure that your program handles both integer and floating-point input values for the radius and precision.
