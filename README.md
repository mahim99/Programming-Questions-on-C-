# Scenario Based Questions:
Q1: Calculate the circumference of a circle without using any libraries for rounding off and manipulation.\
The program requirements are as follows:\
•	The program should prompt the user to enter the radius of the circle.\
•	The program should then prompt the user to enter the precision (number of decimal places) required for the circumference.\
•	The program should calculate the circumference of the circle using the formula \
•	2πr, where  r is the radius.\
•	The program should output the circumference with the specified precision.\
•	Ensure that your program handles both integer and floating-point input values for the radius and precision.

Q2: Longest Arithematic Subarray:
Problem: An arithmetic array is an array that contains at least two integers and the differences between consecutive integers are equal. For example, [9, 10], [3, 3, 3], and [9, 7, 5, 3] are arithmetic arrays, while [1, 3, 3, 7], [2, 1, 2], and [1, 2, 4] are not arithmetic arrays.\
Ques. Sarasvati has an array of N non-negative integers. The i-th integer of the array is Ai. She wants to choose a contiguous arithmetic subarray from her array that has the maximum length. Please help her to determine the length of the longest contiguous arithmetic subarray. 
Input: The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing the integer N. The second line contains N integers. The i-th integer is Ai.
Output: For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the length of the longest contiguous arithmetic subarray.\
Constraints:\
Time limit: 20 seconds per test set.\
Memory limit: 1GB.\
1 <= T <= 100.\
0 <= Ai <= 10^9.\
Test Set 1\
2 <= N <= 2000.\
Test Set 2\
2 <= N <= 2×10^5 for at most 10 test cases.\
For the remaining cases, 2 <= N <= 2000.

Q3:Isyana is given the number of visitors at her local theme park on N consecutive days. The number of visitors on the i-th day is Vi. A day is record breaking if it satisfies both the following conditions:
• The number of visitors on the day is strictly larger than that of the previous days.
• Either it is the last day, or the number of visitors on that day is strictly larger than the number of visitors on the following day.
Note that the very first day could be a record breaking day!\
Please help Isvana find out the number of record breaking days.\
Input: The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing the integer N. The second line contains N integers. The i-th integer is Vi.
Output: For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the number of record breaking days.	
Constraints:\
Time limit: 20 seconds per test set.\
Memory limit: 1GB.\
1 <= T <= 100.\
0 <= Vi <= 2x10^5.\
Test Set 1\
1 <= N <= 1000.\
Test Set 2\
1 <= N <= 2×10^5 for at most 10 test cases.\
For the remaining cases, 1 <= N <= 1000.
