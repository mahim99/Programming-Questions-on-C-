# Programming Questions on C++
# Scenario Based Questions:
Q1: Calculate the circumference of a circle without using any libraries for rounding off and manipulation.\
The program requirements are as follows:\
•	The program should prompt the user to enter the radius of the circle.\
•	The program should then prompt the user to enter the precision (number of decimal places) required for the circumference.\
•	The program should calculate the circumference of the circle using the formula \
•	2πr, where  r is the radius.\
•	The program should output the circumference with the specified precision.\
•	Ensure that your program handles both integer and floating-point input values for the radius and precision.

# Basic Questions:
Q1: Find the largest of the given four numbers, take input from user.\
Q2: Sum of n integers, starting from 0, take input from user.\
Q3: Write a code for user with the following requirements:\
•	The user can go out only on odd days in a month(0-30).\
•	If the pocketmoney of user is over, user cannot go out.\
•	Take pocketmoney input from user.\
•	Print the dates on which the user can go out and the count of those days.\
•	Print the dates on which the user can go out, given they go out on every possible date(consecutively), also print they count of days and the date form which they cannot go out.\
